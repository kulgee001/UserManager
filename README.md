# User Manager

This repository contains a simple demo API built with NodeJS (/app folder).
The API is used to manage users in a MongoDB database.

### Development
This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). MongoDB was used for persisting data with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).

### Installation
* Start up your terminal (or command prompt).
* Ensure that you've `docker` and `git` installed on your PC.
* Clone the repository by entering the command `git clone https://github.com/kulgee001/UserManager` in the terminal.
* Navigate to the project folder using `cd UserManager` on your terminal (or command prompt).
* Then execute the run.sh script with the command `bash run.sh`
